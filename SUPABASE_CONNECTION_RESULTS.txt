// Supabase Connection Verification Summary

Your Supabase setup is working correctly! Here's what the tests confirmed:

âœ… ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: https://ikjvwwkkcsvhzmxskrtq.supabase.co âœ“
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: Configured âœ“ 
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: Configured âœ“

âœ… CONNECTION TEST RESULTS:
- Client-side connection: SUCCESSFUL
- Authentication system: Accessible
- Both anon key and service role key are properly configured

ðŸ’¡ NOTES:
- The "errors" you saw in the tests are expected because we tried to access tables that don't exist yet
- This is normal for a new Supabase project
- The connection itself is working perfectly

ðŸš€ NEXT STEPS:
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard at https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ikjvwwkkcsvhzmxskrtq
2. Create your database tables using the Table Editor or SQL Editor
3. Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies as needed
4. Start building your Next.js application using the Supabase client

The Supabase client is properly configured in your Next.js application and ready to use!
